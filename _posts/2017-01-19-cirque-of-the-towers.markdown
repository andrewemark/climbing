From Texas to the Wind River Range

Clayton and I had been planning to do our first alpine climb in Grand Teton National Park on the classic Exum Direct route. However, just two weeks before our trip, we realized that climbing in the Tetons was going to be somewhat of a hassle. We had already booked our flight from Saturday through Wednesday, but, because the Tetons are so popular in summer, competition for backcountry camping permits on the mountains is stiff. That meant we would have to wake up on Sunday morning, well before dawn, and wait at the ranger station for a permit. Once we got a permit, we’d spend the rest of the day hiking in, setting up camp, and doing a smaller climb. So, we’d throw away a potential full day of climbing on a short, 5 day trip. So, after some Googling and talking to a couple friends, we completely changed our plans: we’d do some climbs in the Cirque of the Towers instead. 

The Cirque is in the southern part of the Wind River Mountain Range of WY, and is basically a giant alpine granite crag. The peaks of the cirque lie at the head of a valley where a glacier once retreated and left a circle of towers in its wake. It also happens to contain two of the fifty classics from Roper and Steck’s “Fifty Classic Climbs of North America”: Wolf’s Head Ridge and Pingora. While we weren’t necessarily set on those particular climbs, they sure did look spectacular. We thought we’d climb the 3 pitch South Buttress of Pingora (5.8) as a warmup on Sunday, then climb the East Ridge of Wolf’s Head on Monday (5.6, 12,163 ft), and finally the classic Grade IV Northeast Face of Pingora (5.8+, 11,884 ft) on Tuesday. We knew weather in the Cirque was highly variable and afternoon thunderstorms were the norm, so even two summits would be considered a great success. 

After arriving by plane to Jackson on Saturday, we drove about 3 hours to the Big Sandy trailhead and did the ~8-9 mile hike in. The net altitude gain was modest (less than a couple thousand feet), but the ups and downs of Jackass Pass, coupled with the thin air at 10,000 feet and 45lb packs, made everything a bit more challenging. Nevertheless, we were at the Cirque after about 4 hours of hiking, just as the sun began to set. We quickly setup camp, made hot food, and passed out without setting an alarm.

We got a slow start (by alpine climbing standards) on Sunday, but the weather was beautiful - not a cloud in the sky. Feeling inspired, we forwent the warm-up climb and instead left for Wolf’s Head at 8am. A 20 minute hike from our tent landed us at the base of the grassy ledges beneath the the notch between Tiger Tower and Wolf’s Head. We scrambled up the 4th to easy 5th class ledges to reach to top of the notch. Next, we climbed about 3 pitches to ascend the ridge. The first included the notorious ‘sidewalk’, a 2 foot wide section of slab with no protection. I lead it, but I didn’t look down till I had some pro in. Clayton carried us up the next segment of the ridge with excellent cracks and hand holds. Finally, I carried us to the base of the first large gendarme that blocked our path.

Clayton lead the first 5.6 pitch, which involved downclimbing and snaking along the left side of the ridge. After one boulder-hugging move, the route entered a cool slot/chimney. I had to send my pack up to Clayton so I could even climb out of the slot.

After climbing out, we were at a large ledge to the right of the second gendarme. Clayton led this pitch as well, which involved clipping a number of pitons through a number of face moves, followed by climbing a fun vertical lieback crack to end the pitch.

We arrived at the 7th true pitch of the route at the base of the 3rd tower. I led the next pitch, a wonderfully exposed hand crack traverse across the base of the tower, followed by a move around a bulge and up to gain the ridge, followed by a downclimb into a cave-like slot.

The 8th pitch was the last 5.6 pitch, and involved downclimbing, followed by another hand crack traverse, followed by downclimbing to the base of a chimney, and the climbing up and out. I couldn’t dislodge one of the nuts that clayton placed on the wide crack traverse. After sticking my leg in the crack for balance and beating the thing for a minute or two, I finally gave up and left the nut in place. You can keep it if you find it! 

The last two pitches carried us over easy terrain to the summit block, where we took some pictures, drank a lot of water, ate some summer sausage, and whined about how rough climbing at altitude felt, but how awesome the views were.

The decent involved about 4 rappels down the backside of the ridge, a lot of scrambling, and some easy climbing to pass through the Overhanging Tower col that lies to the southeast of the Wolf’s Head. After exiting the col, we descended an incredibly loose and annoying scree field, then glissaded some remaining snow. This route made for an awesome first alpine rock experience, but we were seriously exhausted that evening. 

Monday morning the weather was a big change from the previous day: grey, ominous clouds filled the sky, cold wind gusted through the cirque, and precipitation threatened. Realizing that it wasn’t going to be a prime climbing day, we slept in a bit, still recovering from our previous day’s charge into high-altitude climbing. The plan for the day had been to climb the South Buttress, but given the conditions we decided to wait for improvement and instead scope out the approach to the Northeast Face.

This turned out to be a very good idea, as the approach involves weaving through alpine scrub, hopping across a large talus-field, and finding the right ramp upwards to the “rope-up” area before the real climbing begins. It took us a couple hours to find, as the route was not obvious to us from our camp nor did it clearly appear to us as we navigated around the base of Pingora. First we went too far to the north, then circled back back south before attempting to climb upwards towards the face. Traversing southward still, we came upon the rope-up area almost from above. From there, we able to identify where the climb would lead. Having found our destination, and with the weather showing signs of clearing, we made our way back to camp, leaving karins along the way to guide us on our approach the following day. 

Back at camp, it seemed like we may have a shot at climbing the South Buttress, though we were wary of how fast it seemed conditions could change. Waiting around wasn’t easy, since we were both pretty stoked to climb, so we geared up and made our way towards the shoulder of Pingora, which we had to scramble up via a series of switchbacks to arrive at the base of the South Buttress. Halfway up, rain started coming down, so we took cover beneath a small overhang and contemplated our situation. After some deliberation, we retreated back to camp, slightly disheartened. After not too long, however, the rain dissipated, and we charged back up for another go. 

[![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/320/19552773973_de02eab685_c.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vMP5uD)

We weren’t the only ones seeking to seize the window of opportunity - just as we crested the shoulder, we looked up to see a group of about 4 ahead of us, roping up and preparing to climb. We chatted and waited around, contemplating the curiosity of so many of us congregated at this one climb in the middle of an otherwise desolate wilderness. Go figure! I suppose we have Roper & Steck to thank. It got quite chilly just standing around, and the weather was still grey, cloudy, and windy. At least it wasn’t raining.

Finally, it was our turn to climb. It’s hard to remember now, but I think I took the first pitch, which wasn’t the smoothest climbing I have ever done on account of me being cold and stiff. Drew followed up then lead to the base of the K-cracks, if I recall correctly, where I met him and proceeded to lead up the left of the two cracks splitting the face of the buttress. This was an awesome pitch! Mostly laybacking the meandering fingers-to-hands crack on the exposed face leads up to a ledge with bolted rappel anchors. Halfway up the pitch, I got a bit gripped when the weather began to intensify and jammed an orange master cam a little too far back into the irregular crack. Oops, Drew will have to deal with it, I thought. However, even Drew couldn’t get it out as he was following up; we resolved to attempt to retrieve it on rappel.

All this time the sky had been slowly darkening, and almost as soon as Drew joined me at the belay ledge, things took a sharp turn for the worse - hail began to pepper down on us, and the wind kicked up furiously. Woah, there we were almost on top of Pingora, and the wind was so loud we had to yell over it to hear one another! Fairly quickly, we decided to bail ASAP, and in the flurry of tossing the rappel ropes down through blasting winds we totally forgot about the jammed mastercam. After our second rap, the weather was calming, and by the time we made it back to the ground the sun was shining! And it was only then that we realized about our forgotten cam. Man, that was intense! At least we got to climb the best pitch - the final climbing to the summit was just scrambling, and besides, we hoped to be standing up there the following day anyway.

We still had some daylight, which we spent lounging in the meadow next to our tent, organizing our gear for the next day’s climb (Northeast face - the big objective!), eating, drinking coca tea, and generally enjoying the Cirque’s beauty. Warbonnet, Warrior 1 & 2 peaks were spread before us - someday, perhaps, we will return to climb them.

We knew we would need an early start to finish the Northeast face before dark, so that meant an early night. I can’t remember now what time our alarms were set for, but when the time came, it sure felt early. Both Drew and I were tired, and we had to seriously convince each other to get up in the dark and make our way to the climb. We spent longer than I am proud to admit looking out of the tent, still encased in the comfort and warmth of our sleeping bags, deliberating about how threatening the overcast sky looked. It didn’t help that the temps had gotten down to around 29 that night! At long last, however, it was the sentiment of ‘We at least have to make an effort, even if the weather turns sour at the base of the climb’, that got our butts moving. The first step is always the hardest, of course. 

We made the approach to the climb rather swiftly, benefitting greatly from our scouting mission the day before. Despite this, we arrived at the rope up ledge to find a pair of climbers halfway into the first pitch. Oh well, we’d have friends on the climb. It wasn’t too long until another pair came up behind us. It was shaping up to be a beautiful day weather-wise, so our spirits were high.

At some point near the end of the approach, I had a crushing realization: I had left my climbing shoes back at camp. Shit. Hiking back and getting them, then retracing our steps didn’t seem like a feasible option for some reason, so I resolved to climb the route in my approach shoes. I hadn’t mentioned this yet, but these were nearly-brand new 5.10 guide tennies then I had bought specifically for this trip, but foolishly had not broken them in sufficiently beforehand. These shoes had given me the gnarliest blisters on the hike in, and subsequently had made my life significantly more miserable for the past three days. Thank goodness Drew and I had multiple packs of moleskin. I had been doubling up and adding extra thickness with climbing tape just to soften the pain a little. It sorta worked; at any rate, there I was staring up at the soaring Southeast face, resolved to do the thing in approach shoes. Who knows, Maybe I could have done it? They climbed well enough on the first pitch, which I led, involving a tenuous smear move on a somewhat blank slab traverse. But as it turned out, the universe was kind to me that day. 

I was belaying Drew up the first pitch, and chatting with the belayer of the group ahead of us as his partner was on pitch 2. I told him I had forgotten my shoes back at camp, after he made some comment about my approach shoes. He climbed up, and then, at the top of pitch 2, they decided to bail! When they rapped down, we asked what was up, and they said they felt in over their heads. Woah, was pitch 2 that bad? I didn't spend too long pondering though, because like an angel, the guy offered me to use his climbing shoes! No way! I quickly accepted. I think they were a pair of La Sportiva Miuras, very broken in, size 8 or 9. They fit, albeit quite tightly and painfully over my blistered heels (I was wearing socks). But heck, they felt way better than approach shoes, so I was stoked. Now we were the first group on the route, I had real shoes, the sun was out… Let the awesome climbing begin!

Drew took the second pitch lead, and really sewed it up to the point where he ran out of gear ¾ of the way up it! So he built an intermediate anchor and belayed me up. Some face moves transition into a right-facing corner of hand jams and stemming. It’s a pretty long pitch, to be fair. I followed up, swapped out some gear with Drew, and made the jaunt up to a good ledge where it was possible to bail from. I was feeling good, and took the lead on p3. I think this involved following a right-facing corner/flake up through a mini-roof, to a belay at a decent stance. Drew followed up, but wasn’t feeling stoked to lead for some reason, so I continued leading. I ended up leading the rest of the pitches, all the way to the top!

It’s hard for me to remember pitch-by-pitch at this point, but I recall another pitch of somewhat strenuous laybacking to in a right-facing corner to get to another ledge, where we had some trouble deciding where the route went. We picked the left-hand way, a shallow but not too steep crack system with good stances, kinda ramp-ish. I followed this feature upwards for 1-2 pitches, then had to move right and around to avoid a crack that petered out. This put us in front of the cruxy pitch, a flared, OW-ish crack section. Number 4 was key here. I did thrutch a bit, and grunt, and feel pretty insecure, but I made it, adrenaline pumping! I kept getting slings caught on my helmet as I was pulling them over my head (they were slung around my shoulder), which pissed me off. I felt embarrassed for my expletives though when Drew told be the guy behind us made it look easy. Haha, oh well! The alpine factor probably had me a bit more gripped than if it were E-rock, for sure. Somehow it felt quite exposed and airy. I guess we were at least 500 feet up the face!

The climbing steepened from there, as we climbed up good cracks and more consistent jamming. The second-to-last pitch I remember as being quite exciting as well - with a step-across move from a flake to a crack that felt a bit insecure. But the views were awesome, and we were almost there! The final pitch is a short chimney. I stuck the #4 way in the back and shimmied up until I could grab the lip - almost falling! - but again, after some expletives and grunting I was on top. Drew had a fun time hauling the pack between his legs up this chimney!

Woohoo, we made it! After shooting several victory photos, we scouted a bit around the summit block before deciding it wasn’t worth the hassle. We teamed up with the group behind us to descend - they needed help finding the rap, which was the same station we had fled from the previous day in the hail storm. It was much nicer weather this day! A quick hike & scramble across the top of Pingora and we found the chains. Having two sets of ropes made the raps go quickly. Before too long we were back on the ground, I was lacing up my approach shoes again, and the sun was still out. What an amazing climb! Looking up from camp, it was hard to believe that we had been standing atop that granite tower just a few hours before. Our friends were camping near the original first group, so I gave them the loaner shoes to return. I also told them to convey my deepest gratitude… that was a serious lifesaver.

We were feeling quite accomplished - we had just crushed the northeast face, had conquered the south buttress (sort of) yesterday, and the day before that had charged up the Wolf’s Head. We were in an amazingly beautiful place, and had done the best climbing of our lives. It was a good dinner that night, whatever it was!

The next day we got up early again to pack up and make it out on time to catch our flight… It was going to be tight, with the 3-hour drive back to Jackson, so we tried to book it back to the car as fast as we could. This hike out, I felt like my body was realizing what it had been put through. Suffice it to say that my tired, blistered feet were very, very glad to finally make it back the car!

The drive went fast, and we even had time to stop in a restaurant in Jackson and order… Bison Burgers! Each of which came with an ENORMOUS plate of fries. We were two hungry dudes, for sure, but even we couldn’t finish those fries off. Oh well. Full and content, we did some gear arrangement in the parking lot, completed the drive up to the airport, and soon enough we were off, soaring back to Austin, TX, with visions of alpine spires, glacial lakes, and future adventures in our minds.
