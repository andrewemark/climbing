RED ROCK (Andrew’s voice)

Clayton and I flew from Austin to Las Vegas on a late flight one Wednesday evening in November. After loading up on a burrito from a local Mexican food joint at 1am (Tacos Mexico, open 24 hours, a great pit stop if you ever land late at night in Vegas…), we arrived in a smoky casino near the airport to spend the night. As is typical on climbing trips, all that went through my brain that night was the big sandstone walls we’d soon be climbing. I couldn’t sleep in, and Clayton is a good sport, so we were cruising in the rental car towards Red Rock Canyon by 8:30am the following morning. 

While the primary objective of our trip was the Zion classic, Touchstone Wall, the appeal and convenience of Red Rock was too hard to resist. Both Clayton and I had had the super classic Red Rock route, Epinephrine, high on our tick lists ever since we had heard about it. We had both been to Red Rock before, but didn’t feel that we were adequately prepared for the long, slick, and foreboding chimneys of Epinephrine. 

We opted to climb a smaller Red Rock chimney on our first day in the canyon. We settled on a climb called Black Widow Hollow, which the guidebook called “a great warm up for Epinephrine”. As we would later find out, this is an understatement. 

We approached the climb in Pine Creek Canyon in about 30-40 minutes at a leisurely pace. The route was relatively easy to find, lying on the southeast face of Mescalito, just around the corner from a popular route, The Cat in the Hat. Upon arriving at the base, Clayton climbed up a low fifth class pitch and set a belay at a tree. I arrived at the belay and launched off into the 200+ foot chimney pitch. This thing was really a squeeze. At one point, I had to exhale fully, slide body into the deep part of the chimney, place pro, and exhale deeply to get out and climb again. I also took a bit of skin off my nose while trying to turn my head in the squeeze. About 100 feet up the pitch, I found a good belay and decided to let Clayton do the other half of the pitch for practice. He led us through a couple more cruxy chimney sections before emerging on the face.

By the time we were both at the next anchor, the chimney was over, and we were pretty tired. This thing was a solid 5.9 chimney climbing (we presumed). We decided to skip the last pitch (some 5.8 crack and face climbing), and do some single pitch climbs in Pine Creek Canyon in an effort to conserve energy for Epinephrine. We easily scrambled down and climber’s left to find the rappel stations for The Cat in the Hat, allowing an easy descent. On our hike out, we got on one fun 5.9 finger crack, Straight Shooter, but then had to make a run for the parking lot before the road closed for the evening. 

The next day, we awoke very early in the Red Rock campground, fixed a quick breakfast, and set off towards Black Velvet Canyon. By early, I mean before 4am—we knew it was a popular route, and our goal was to be first in line. We cruised down the rough roads to the trailhead without much trouble and shortly arrived in the parking lot. We left the car around 5:30am and arrived at the base of Epinephrine after about an hour of hiking. We only got lost and bushwhacked in the dark for about 20 minutes—our advice is to stay in the dry creek bed for longer than you think! 

When we finally arrived at the base of the first pitch (which starts as a 30 ft bolted slab), we ditched all but two bottles of water, hoping to travel light through the 600 feet of chimney climbing ahead. We shoved the topos in our pockets and dropped our gear in a single small pack so only one person would have to trail a pack in the chimneys. We opted to take a single 70m rope, hoping we could link pitches together. While I was initially worried that the chimneys were going to be cold without extra layers, ditching them turned out to be the right choice—the weather was nearly perfect. 

We scrambled up easy 5th class ledges just upstream in order to bypass the bolts of the first pitch, which didn't seem like a natural start of the line. When we arrived at the base of the 2nd pitch, we realized there were already two parties ahead of us. We patiently waited for about an hour, then started up the 2nd and 3rd pitches, skirting the party ahead of us by climbing a face to the right of the first, easy chimney. This seems like a useful strategy when the route is crowded. Fortunately, the first party on the route was so fast, we didn’t see them all day.

And then began the main event: a wide, clean chimney with smooth walls. I was stoked to get to lead this pitch. I began by climbing up relatively easy cracks with ample protection opportunities until the cracks petered out. And then it was time to get into chimney climbing mode. For much of the pitch, there is protection to be had deep in the chimney. However, getting deep in the chimney is much more taxing than climbing in the middle of it. So the pitch turned into a runout affair with me placing pro about every 15 feet or so. The chimney felt solid, though tiring and spooky. When the chimney widened near the top, I was able to lock off my legs horizontally, which offered a fantastic rest. Towards the end of the pitch, the chimney pinched down a bit. I got deeper inside to get some protection before reaching a decent belay ledge on the chimney wall. 

Clayton ascended the chimney in style, though the leader pack he trailed came unclipped at one stage. Luckily for the 4-5 parties behind us, the pack got wedged in the chimney only a short distance below. First lesson from the trip: always use a locking carabiner when trailing the pack!  When Clayton arrived at the belay, he was gassed from trailing the pack, so in the interest of time, I offered to lead the next chimney pitch to the top of the Black Tower.

While Clayton thought this pitch was easier, I actually found it to be harder, though most likely because it was necessarily run out and I was facing the wrong direction. Definitely go right shoulder in. The protection was scant other than a couple of bolts a good way up the pitch. Clayton had absolutely no issues with the climbing on this pitch. But, he did manage to drop something again. Clayton yells “Clif Bar!!!” to the parties below, which they translate to “ROCK!!!” to all the parties below them. Luckily, nobody was hurt and Clayton arrives at the belay feeling a bit embarrassed about his butterfingers, but stoked to start leading again. 

Once we reached the top of the tower, the face climbing began. Clayton linked the next two awesome face climbing pitches with ease to the top of the “Elephant’s Trunk”. This was pure fun on great quality rock with easy pro, allowing us to move really fast. We proceeded through about three to four more straightforward and fun face pitches, stretching the rope with each pitch until the angle of the rock began to taper, and the route proceeded rightward. The views down the canyon at this point were spectacular. We could see, and hear, many parties on other routes on Black Velvet Wall. At one point we were startled by a couple of biplanes dive-bombing and barrel-rolling into the canyon, just a few hundred yards away from us. 

We opted to simul-climb when the angle eased, which allowed us to move very quickly. We continued for a few hundred feet towards the top of Black Velvet Peak along a relaxed, rightward leaning ramp, capped by a giant pine tree at its finish. After reaching the big tree, we unroped, and walked up about another 200-300 vertical feet to the top of Black Velvet Peak. The expansive vista of the desert and Las Vegas was incredible, and it was hard to believe we had covered so many vertical feet. 

While we had heard that many parties have epic’d on the descent, we had no issues.  We followed a ridgeline east from the Black Velvet summit, marked by ample cairns, until a winding and steep trail led to the northeast down the side of the ridge. After dropping down about 1000 ft, we joined the descent trail leading off Whiskey Peak, which we followed back to the main trail and onwards towards the parking lot. Another 30-45 minutes of walking got us back to our prizes: delicious warm beer and water at the car.

Overall, Epinephrine was a really phenomenal climb, and we felt accomplished having climbed it in good style, making it back to the car well before dark. The following day, Saturday, was a planned rest day, which we used to pack up and drive towards St. George, Utah, where we would be staying with a family friend of Clayton’s for the night. 


ZION (Clayton’s voice)

After not much more than a short hike on Saturday, we felt well-rested as we drove into Zion National Park on Sunday morning. Despite this being my third visit to the park in four years, I still could not help but stare at the towering red walls that surround the town of Springdale at the mouth of the canyon. The knowledge that this time I would actually be doing some serious climbing heightened my excitement, but I have to admit I also was a little intimidated. For some reason, Zion’s massive blank faces and sandy ridges were more foreboding than the tall walls of Black Velvet canyon, despite their apparent similarities. The hue of the sandstone was a deeper red here, seemingly more powerful. The cold wind that whipped through our campsite as we set up the tent didn’t make us feel any more comfortable. On top of it all, we did not see anyone else who was obviously a climber, another distinction from the scene at Red Rock where climbers’ vans and trucks were double-triple-parked throughout the campground.

With camp set at the Watchman campground, we drove back to the visitor center to get some beta about the climbs we hoped to do, and catch the shuttle into the canyon (the only way in and out of the interior of the canyon at this time of the year). To the climbing/backcountry ranger, we asked about rappelling Touchstone Wall in case of retreat, and also about the warm-up climb we hoped to do called Organasm. Yes, we could rappel the face of Touchstone, and Organasm? He’d never done it.
 
The shuttle deposited us in a small parking lot perched above the Virgin river, the Big Bend stop. We had a great view of our primary objective, the Cerberus Gendarme which Touchstone ascended, as well as the much more massive north face of Angel’s Landing looming across the canyon. However, our immediate objective was the Organasm, a much shorter climb found on the north face of the Pipe Organs formation, the long, thin ridgeline sweeping down from the top of Angel's Landing that forced the Virgin River into a wide bend. The Organasm had been recommended as a good practice aid route, and contained a roof crack, allegedly similar to what we would face on Touchstone. We followed the footpath leading from the parking lot down towards the Virgin River, and eventually determined a reasonable place to cross. Barefoot, fighting to keep my balance on the smooth stones below, the icy water felt pleasantly refreshing to me (not so much to Andrew). After re-lacing our shoes, we scrambled up the sandy riverbank and took stock of the climb. The roof was no joke, completely horizontal for about 20 feet and containing a splitter hand crack. 

Andrew took the lead on the first pitch, free climbing that progressed from stemming and laybacking to a burly hand and fist crack. It felt pretty stout for 5.8, and as I followed up I had to struggle to get good fist jams deep in the widening crack. Not the gentlest warm-up. I was out of breath when I reached the belay, but stoked to get my aid ladders out and put my newly acquired aid climbing skills into practice. In preparation for this trip, Andrew and I had spent several weekends practicing aid climbing at the only trad area we have nearby Austin, Enchanted Rock. We had even aid climbed an overhanging limestone sport route closer to town, hanging on a fifi hook and stretching to reach bolt to bolt. We had the fundamentals down, but had never climbed anything close to the huge roof we were now staring up at. This was bound to be a learning experience.

I set off up the splitter hand crack leading to the roof in full aid climbing mode, though in hindsight this would have been some sweet free climbing. I sunk in each cam and tried to climb to the highest step on my ladder, striving to conserve gear and move efficiently. When I reached the roof, I used a fifi hook to hang directly on my gear, making it less strenuous to stretch out and place my next piece. I extended the first piece or two I placed in the roof, thinking more about reducing rope drag than how Andrew would follow and clean. I was moving well, and felt great to be in the position I was in, hanging below this awesome sandstone roof, above the Virgin River and across the canyon from Touchstone Wall. All the gear to the end of the roof was bomber, but as I pulled the lip, I had to start getting more “creative” with my placements. Standing on these pieces had my heart racing, but luckily everything held and I made steady upward progress. Soon, I was 20 feet below the anchors, facing a uniform 2” crack, and the only piece I had aside from tiny stuff was a BD #1, which was very tipped out in this crack, nearly useless. 

I had a strange experience in this moment. My rational brain saw a splitter hand crack that would be no problem to free climb comfortably to the anchors. But I was hesitant to step out of my ladders. The dicey gear below had me spooked, and so I spent a good 15-20 minutes just standing in my ladders, contemplating the switch from aid to free, reluctant to commit. Eventually I went for it, and had no problems once I was moving. It felt really enjoyable to finally sink a few hand jams after all that aid climbing. I fixed the rope at the bolted anchors and let Andrew know he was good to ascend. 

Andrew’s task was to jug up the fixed line, cleaning gear as he went. We had practiced cleaning and jugging about a half dozen times, but never on anything as overhanging as the roof on this climb. Suffice it to say that Andrew took a long, long time to clean this pitch, spent a significant amount of that time dangling and spinning in space, and learned a big lesson about how to clean an overhanging pitch the hard way (the second lesson of our trip!). Unfortunately, we had to leave a BD #1 in the roof, as it was out of Andrew’s reach once he weighted the next piece, unclipped, and swung out. In hindsight, re-aiding the pitch would have probably been the best technique, but that didn’t even cross our minds at the time. We felt a little defeated, a little embarrassed, and definitely humbled as we rapped down to the base from the top of pitch 2.

Hoping to make the best use of our remaining daylight, we turned our sights across the canyon towards Touchstone Wall. In planning this trip, we had played with the idea of attempting a one-day ascent of Touchstone, but thanks to the ego-deflating experience we had just gone through, we decided on the fly to opt for the “fix and fire” approach. This would involve us climbing the first 2 to 3 pitches, fixing our ropes, rappelling down, and then returning the following day to ascend to our previous high point and complete the route. We felt good about this approach now, as it gave us a wider margin of error in case things did not go as planned on the route. By the time we made our way back across the river and up to the base of the climb, our spirits were high again. We felt back on track, confident, and stoked for the vertical (more or less) aid climbing that lay before us. 

The first pitch of Touchstone Wall is a pure “bolt” ladder of drilled angle pitons in the otherwise blank face, arching upwards and to the right to reach the base of the crack system. I was feeling anxious to make upward progress, and took the lead. The climbing was repetitive, but surprisingly enjoyable—clipping the next aid ladder, transferring my weight, cleaning my previous ladder and clipping the rope through a quickdraw—then climbing to the top step and repeating. Between a couple of the bolts, I was at the limit of my reach, and used the fifi hook to lever off the bolt at my waist to barely clip the next one. It was a challenge of balance and efficiency. Before too long, I was at the base of a thin crack, which I aid climbed on gear about 20 to 30 ft to reach the bolted anchors. Everything went smoothly, and before I knew it, Andrew had cleaned the pitch, ascended the fixed rope, and joined me at the belay.

The second pitch, which Andrew led, involved more aiding up the thin crack, a small traverse, and then surmounting a small roof. The placement just over the lip of the roof seemed to be the crux, in that it was the sketchiest piece to commit to: a broken piton that flexed when weighted. After some deliberation, Andrew didn't have much trouble pulling the lip, aiding up the headwall and reaching the second belay. The sun was setting now, so I jugged and cleaned as quickly as I could. The traverse under the roof required some trickery with my ascenders to clean, and sent me on short swing out to space once I freed the last piece before the lip. I continued on and finally joined Andrew in complete darkness. Working by headlamp, we rapped back down to the base of the route, leaving our two 70m ropes fixed on the wall up to the start of pitch 3. Riding the shuttle back to our campsite, we felt like we had rebounded from our mishap on Organasm, and were stoked to get after it the next day.

We were back to the base by 8am the following morning, just as the canyon was beginning to brighten. Jugging two pitches straight up was an exciting way to start the day. But, thanks to all our jugging practice back in Austin, it wasn’t too clunky or inefficient. It wasn’t long before I was stepping into my aid ladder on lead up pitch 3. This is a long, thin crack blasting straight up the face of Touchstone Wall. I knew that it went free at 5.11, and while I had fantasized about trying to free it in the months leading up to this trip, it was much more intimidating than I had expected. Plus, we were trying to make good time, and I was here to practice my aid climbing skills, right? These were my excuses! Perhaps someday I’ll return to attempt the free send, because it truly is a stellar crack. Even though I was wearing gloves, I found myself sinking finger locks to stabilize myself as I climbed up my aid ladder. Aiding was certainly not without its challenges, anyways, and pretty soon I got into an enjoyable rhythm, similar to the bolt ladder pitch but with the added excitement of selecting, testing, and committing to each piece in the relatively soft, red sandstone. None of my pieces totally popped, through I had a close call where two lobes of a cam popped out of the crack while I was standing on it! Thankfully, the inner two lobes held tight while I frantically slammed in another, less sketchy piece to stand on. With no other mishaps, I eventually arrived at a bolted belay just before the angle began to ease off slightly, and the crack began to widen. I fixed the rope, and occupied myself with belay station organization while Andrew jugged and cleaned. My notorious propensity to set my nuts just a little too hard caused us to lose some time as Andrew struggled to clean them. I basked in the full sun hitting the south-facing wall, shedding layers, while Andrew carried out his work. 

After some time Andrew made it up to join me, and took the rack for the next lead. Here we switched from approach shoes/boots into climbing shoes, as the crack was climbable at 5.9 with some 5.10 moves interspersed that could be French-freed if necessary. The long pitch ended on a cozy ledge. As I followed up, Andrew was able to lean over and snap photos of me while I struggled with the 5.10b section, which I could not pull off! It consisted of super thin fingers in a shallow sandy corner to surmount a bulge. I pulled on some gear, and was huffing and puffing when I reached the ledge. The climbing was no joke. 

Sticking to our pattern of swapping leads, I led pitch four, which consisted of burly fist jams up to a nice big ledge. The climbing was challenging and enjoyable, but it was beginning to hit me how much harder everything felt than I had expected. Perhaps it was nerves, or all the extra gear at my waist: we had brought a rack sufficient for aiding the lower cracks, which meant 3-5 copies of some sizes of cams. I understood what another climber at Red Rock meant when he compared aid climbing to “blue-collar climbing”—it was unavoidably physical, with all that clunky gear and weight. The simplicity and lightness of free climbing seemed particularly alluring to me in that moment.

Andrew led pitch 6, a sandy ramp over a sandy bulgy to a sandy hand crack. Yes, this pitch was sandy. Regardless, still very fun, once we embraced the nature of it. I followed up and quickly took off on pitch 7, which consisted of a perfect hand crack, strenuous fist jamming, and then a small squeeze chimney, which felt natural after Epinephrine. After wandering up some low-angle terrain, I built an anchor in a small crack to belay Andrew up. The pine tree (part of the route on the first ascent) was right in front of me, as was the last actual pitch of climbing. We were almost there.

The final pitch, which I had the pleasure of leading, was moderate face climbing protected by pitons—a unique style for Zion! I moved around a corner, up a sandy ramp, and over a sketchy mantle to reach to reach the top of the Cerberus Gendarme. Andrew soon joined, and we enjoyed a much deserved rest, explored the summit for the views, and snapped photos. We had a great perspective on the Moonlight Buttress across the canyon, as well as spectacular views of the North face of Angel’s Landing and the Virgin River as it snaked down the valley. 

Without wasting too much time, we started off on the descent, which involved a short ridge traverse, then many rappels interspersed with scrambling down a gulley. This may have been the most dangerous part of the day given the condition of some of the rappel anchors (Star Dryvins bolts, and ratty-tatty rap slings). Fortunately we made it unscathed to the last drop-off ledge, and one final long rappel brought us back to the ground. The descent had consumed several hours, and it was fully dark when we touched down. 

At this point, it sunk in: we had climbed Toughstone Wall successfully. All the planning, training, and dreaming culminated as perfectly as we could have hoped for. The feelings we felt are familiar if you’ve experienced them—the warm glow of all-day physical effort, the sense of safety after prolonged exposure, all steeped in the joy of accomplishment. We felt pretty damn good, and slept quite soundly that night.

The following day, the last day of the trip, turned out to be a rest and recovery day. A drive and hike up in Kolob Canyon felt just right, to get the body moving without much stress on the hands, fingers, and skin. On our hike, we eyed some awesome-looking lines on the big walls in Kolob Canyon. We didn’t see another soul the whole time. What special places, Zion and Kolob both. Before we even drove out of the canyon, I was already thinking about when I could return.
